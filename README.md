**SubFlow** is a powerful Python script designed to automate the process of downloading and translating subtitles for video files. It integrates seamlessly with OpenSubtitles and uses AI-powered translation models to translate subtitles into your desired language.

## **Features**

  - Automatically downloads subtitles in your preferred language (e.g., Spanish) using OpenSubtitles.
  - Falls back to English subtitles if the preferred language is unavailable.

- **AI-Powered Translation**:

- **Customizable**:
  - Configure OpenSubtitles credentials directly in the script.
  - Set your target language (default is Spanish, but you can change it to French, German, etc.).

- **Logging**:
  - Detailed logs are generated for successful downloads, failed attempts, and translations.
